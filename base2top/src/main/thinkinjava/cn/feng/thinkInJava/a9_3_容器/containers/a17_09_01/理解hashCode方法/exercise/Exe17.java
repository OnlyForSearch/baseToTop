/**
 * The SlowMap2 class already uses all of Map (which you can test by invoking
 * each method listed in Map on SlowMap2). The two most frequently
 * overridden methods of AbstractMap (besides those already overridden in
 * SlowMap2) are containsKey( ) and remove( ). Their default use requires
 * linear time in the size of the map though, which is awkward. However,
 * overriding them in SlowMap2 gains nothing. You really can’t speed up the
 * code, so extra development is unnecessary.
 * Remember, sometimes the abstract base version of the container you are
 * creating already uses the methods you need (not that you create your own
 * containers all that often).
